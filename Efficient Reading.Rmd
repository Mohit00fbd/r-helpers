## Tips for read.table
* If there's no comment, make comment `r comment.char = ""`.  
* Define colClasses argument by yourself, if the dataset has many columns you can use the following snippet. 
```{r}
initial <- read.table("database.txt", nrows=100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
tabAll <- read.table("database.txt", colClasses = classes)
```
